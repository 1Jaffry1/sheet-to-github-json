If the state of ihram was entered in the previous lunar month and the rites of the ʿUmrah were carried out in the current month, then it is permissible to perform another ʿUmrah for oneself in that month.\nHowever, if one ʿUmrah is performed for oneself and the other on behalf of someone else, or if both are performed on behalf of two different individuals, then this restriction does not apply.",
