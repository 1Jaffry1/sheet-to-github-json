  "sp1_note": "Please note:\nIt is recommended as a precaution to perform the sa‘y immediately after the tawaf and its prayer, following the adhan. However, it is apparent that delaying it until the night or the following day is permissible.\n\nIn a situation of choice (i.e., without necessity), delaying the sa‘y until the next day is not considered obligatory precaution, but it is better to delay the sa‘y until after the morning (Fajr) prayer.\n\nIf one intentionally delays the sa‘y until the next day, then according to obligatory precaution, one must repeat the tawaf and its prayer.\n\nIt is permissible to perform the tawaf before the morning prayer, then perform the morning prayer, and afterward perform the sa‘y.",
