  "tawaf_guidance_item2": "Covering the private parts during Tawaf is required—based on obligatory precaution—within the same limits that are required for prayer. Moreover, it is preferable, and rather based on precaution, to observe all the conditions of a prayer performer’s clothing during Tawaf, in fact for all garments worn by the person performing Tawaf.",

  "tawaf_guidance_item3": "If the upper level (floor) is higher than the structure of the Sacred Kaaba, performing Tawaf from that level is not valid.",
  "tawaf_guidance_item4": "The Tawaf prayer must be performed immediately after Tawaf. Therefore, those who are unable to perform the prayer themselves must appoint a representative (proxy) so that customary continuity (muwālāt ‘urfī) is not lost."
